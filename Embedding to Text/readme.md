### 1. Project Goal and Background

The goal of this project is to develop a content recommendation system for FCZP (https://fczp.app), an iOS application that offers generative podcast content using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Text-to-Speech (TTS) technologies. The FCZP app generates personalized podcast episodes, and each episode summary is saved in a database along with a 1536-dimensional embedding, generated using the OpenAI embedding model.

Currently, the FCZP app has fewer than 10,000 episodes. Unlike platforms with massive content volumes, such as YouTube, where straightforward recommendations suffice, the limited content pool makes traditional recommendation methods—such as cosine similarity in the embedding space—less effective. Even with cosine similarity, the available episodes are insufficient to provide truly novel recommendations.

To overcome this limitation, the project aims to develop an AI system capable of identifying points in the embedding space that represent new content similar to a user's preferences. By generating a new point in the user's preference cluster, the system can create a novel summary—a few lines describing the content of a hypothetical new episode. From this summary, a full episode can then be generated, providing an engaging and unique experience for the user.

A key component of this project is the **reconstruction** of summaries. Reconstruction involves using generative models to take incomplete or incoherent generated content and transform it into a coherent, contextually accurate summary. This process helps bridge the gap between the limited dataset and the need for novel recommendations by ensuring generated content remains relevant and engaging. Reconstruction is crucial for maintaining privacy and coherence, as embeddings can potentially reveal significant information. Techniques like structured prompts and multi-step iterative methods can be used to enhance reconstruction quality while ensuring data privacy.

Reconstruction is a critical aspect of this project because it directly addresses the challenge of generating coherent content from sparse data. The importance of reconstruction has also been highlighted in related research, such as the InvBERT study (Kugler et al., 2023), which demonstrated the feasibility of reconstructing original text from contextualized embeddings. The study emphasizes the potential risks and challenges associated with reconstruction, particularly in terms of privacy and coherence. By focusing on reconstruction, this project ensures that generated podcast content is not only personalized but also maintains high quality and relevance, despite the limited dataset available.

**Key Objectives:**
- Use generative models (e.g., VAEs, GANs, LLMs) to create diverse and engaging content.
- Address limitations of traditional recommendation systems.
- Improve personalization and diversity of recommendations.
- Develop a method for generating new content representations based on user preference clusters.

**Previous Experiment:**
- A trial using BART with 1,100 data points faced challenges with coherence, leading to exploration of alternative models.

**Technology Stack:**
- **OpenAI Embedding Model**: Used to generate 1536-dimensional embeddings for episode summaries.
- **Generative Models**: VAEs, GANs, and LLMs for creating new content representations.
- **TTS Technology**: Converts generated content into spoken podcasts.

**Challenges and Limitations:**
- **Limited Dataset**: Fewer than 10,000 episodes make traditional recommendation techniques insufficient.
- **Computational Resources**: Training generative models, especially GANs and LLMs, requires significant computational power.
- **Coherence of Generated Content**: Ensuring that generated content is coherent and engaging is a key challenge.
- **Privacy Concerns**: Embedding inversion attacks can reconstruct original text from embeddings, posing privacy risks. Proper privacy-preserving measures are necessary to mitigate these risks.

**Evaluation Metrics:**
- **Coherence and Diversity**: Measure the quality and novelty of generated content.
- **User Engagement**: Metrics such as click-through rates, time spent on generated episodes, and user feedback.
- **Relevance to User Preferences**: Evaluate how well the generated content aligns with user embedding clusters.

**Ethical Considerations:**
- **Bias in Recommendations**: Address potential biases in generated content to ensure fairness and inclusivity.
- **Transparency**: Clearly communicate to users that generated content is AI-driven.
- **Privacy**: Protect user data and ensure that embeddings do not reveal personal information, as embeddings may leak substantial original information. Proper privacy measures must be taken to mitigate these risks.

### Insights from Experimentation

The recent experiment focused on reconstructing episode summaries using the model Claude 3.5 Sonnet to understand the coherence and relevance of generated content compared to the original summaries.

**Key Findings:**
1. **Reconstruction Quality**: The reconstructed summaries, while maintaining some elements of the original context, often diverged significantly in coherence and focus. The model frequently introduced new, unrelated information, which sometimes made the summaries more imaginative but less faithful to the original content.
2. **Generated Content Analysis**: The generated summaries lacked coherence and structure, leading to a loss of important details from the original summaries. Key information about events, specific names, and locations was frequently omitted or incorrectly represented.
3. **Improvement in Reconstruction**: Reconstructed summaries were generally better at providing coherent narratives compared to the initial generated summaries. These reconstructions demonstrated the potential of using a structured prompt to guide the model towards more coherent and contextually accurate outputs.
4. **Challenges with Ambiguity**: The model faced challenges when reconstructing summaries involving multiple complex entities or events. Ambiguity in the generated content led to inconsistent and sometimes incorrect representations of key information.
5. **Diversity vs. Accuracy**: The reconstructed summaries often exhibited high diversity, incorporating imaginative elements. However, this came at the cost of factual accuracy, which is crucial for generating high-quality content recommendations.

**Summary of Experiment Outcomes:**
- **Reconstruction vs. Generation**: Reconstructed summaries showed improvement over initial generation attempts, demonstrating the potential of prompting strategies for refining content coherence and relevance.
- **Need for Enhanced Guidance**: Effective guidance through structured prompts and constraints is necessary to balance creativity with accuracy. This can help in generating more reliable and engaging episode summaries.
- **Implications for Content Generation**: The experiment highlights the need to use enhanced control mechanisms, such as reinforcement learning or human-in-the-loop feedback, to ensure the generated content aligns well with user preferences and maintains coherence.
